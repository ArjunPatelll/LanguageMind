# Generate text using fine-tuned GPT-2 model

#### Description:
This project is aimed at leveraging the power of large language models, specifically the GPT-2 model, for text generation. The code demonstrates how to load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer using the `transformers` library. It then generates text based on a given prompt using the fine-tuned GPT-2 model. The generated text is decoded using the tokenizer and printed to the console.

The project can be extended to incorporate more advanced usage of GPT-2, such as generating text conditioned on specific attributes or fine-tuning the model on custom datasets.
