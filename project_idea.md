# Research Report: Generative Pre-trained Transformers for Code Summarization

## Abstract:
In this research, we explore the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models for code summarization. Code summarization aims to automatically generate concise and informative summaries of code snippets, thereby assisting developers in understanding code and improving software maintenance and comprehension. We investigate the effectiveness of GPT models in capturing the high-level semantic information from code and generating meaningful summaries. We evaluate our approach on a large dataset of code snippets and compare it with existing code summarization techniques.

## Introduction:
Code summarization is an important task in software engineering, especially when working with large-scale codebases. Manually reading and understanding code can be time-consuming and error-prone, thus motivating the need for automated code summarization techniques. The goal of code summarization is to generate short and descriptive summaries that capture the primary functionality of the code, without explicitly executing it.

Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models have shown remarkable performance in a variety of natural language processing tasks. These models, trained on massive amounts of text data, can generate coherent and contextually relevant text. Inspired by the success of GPT models in language generation tasks, we hypothesize that they can also be effective in generating high-quality summaries for code snippets.

## Proposed Approach:
To apply GPT models to code summarization, we propose the following approach:

1. Dataset Preparation:
   - Collect a large corpus of code snippets from open-source repositories.
   - Extract the code snippets along with their corresponding human-written summaries.
   - Preprocess the code snippets and summaries by tokenizing them and encoding them using appropriate techniques (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding).

2. Model Training:
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT model on the code snippet-summary pairs.
   - Use techniques such as teacher forcing and masked language modeling during training to guide the model to generate accurate and meaningful summaries.
   - Employ regularization techniques, such as dropout and layer normalization, to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

3. Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the trained model using established code summarization evaluation metrics, such as BLEU score, ROUGE score, and METEOR score.
   - Compare the performance of the GPT-based approach with existing code summarization techniques, such as Seq2Seq models and Transformer-based models.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Investigate the impact of various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and model size, on the performance of the GPT-based code summarization model.
   - Perform a grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

## Expected Outcomes:
We anticipate that our research on employing GPT models for code summarization will yield the following outcomes:

1. A GPT-based code summarization model that can generate concise and meaningful summaries for code snippets.
2. Comparative evaluation of the GPT-based approach with existing code summarization techniques, providing insights into its advantages and limitations.
3. Identification of optimal hyperparameter settings for the GPT-based code summarization model.
4. Dataset annotations and preprocessing techniques that can aid future research in code summarization.

## Conclusion:
This research aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models for code summarization. Successful application of GPT models in code summarization can significantly benefit software developers by automating the process of code comprehension. By generating accurate and informative code summaries, developers can save time and effort in understanding unfamiliar code snippets. We believe that this research can contribute to the advancement of code summarization techniques and facilitate the development of more efficient software systems.
