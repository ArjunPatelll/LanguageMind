```python

def complete_code(model_path, tokenizer_path, code_snippet):
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_path)
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_path)
    
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(code_snippet, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=5, pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)

    completed_code = [tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True) for output in outputs]
    return completed_code

model_path = "path/to/pretrained_model"
tokenizer_path = "path/to/tokenizer"

snippet = '''
def multiply(a, b):
    # TODO: implement code to multiply two numbers

This project aims to develop a large language model specifically designed for code completion tasks. The model can be fine-tuned on a code corpus to generate code snippets given an incomplete code as input. The generated code snippets can then be used to provide suggestions and auto-completion to developers, making their coding process more efficient and error-free.

The code snippet provided demonstrates how the model can be used to complete an incomplete multiplication function. After fine-tuning the language model on a large code corpus, the `complete_code` function takes a pre-trained model and tokenizer path, along with a code snippet as input. It then generates multiple code completions for the given snippet and returns them as a list of strings.

Users can experiment with different fine-tuned models, tokenizer configurations, and code snippets to explore the capabilities of the language model. The project can be extended by incorporating additional code-specific training datasets, experimenting with different transformer architectures, and building a convenient user interface for easy integration and usage.
